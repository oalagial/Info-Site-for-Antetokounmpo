                <h1>Giannis Antetokounmpo - NBA</h1>
                <p>Giannis is a is a Greek professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National
                    Basketball Association (NBA). He officially gained Greek citizenship on May 9, 2013,[87] with the
                    official romanization of his name being Giannis Antetokounmpo.[88] His nickname is the "Greek
                    Freak".[89]

                    Antetokounmpo's father, Charles, was a former Nigerian football player, while his mother, Veronica,
                    is a former high jumper.[9] Charles died in September 2017, at age 54.[59] Veronica gave each of
                    her five sons both Greek and Nigerian names, choosing the Nigerian Ougko (/ˈuːɡoʊ/ OO-goh) for
                    Giannis.[90]

                    Antetokounmpo has two older brothers, Francis (Greek name Andreas) and Thanasis, as well as two
                    younger brothers, Kostas and Alexis.[91] He and Thanasis were teammates in Filathlitikos, with
                    Kostas later joining the squad in the 2013–14 season. His oldest brother, Francis, has played
                    football professionally in Nigeria, and both basketball and football professionally in Greece. The
                    entire Antetokounmpo family except for Francis and Thanasis moved from Athens to Milwaukee in early
                    2014.[92] In July 2016, Giannis and Thanasis began their mandatory military service in Greece. The
                    two brothers served a reduced three-month military service, as prescribed for Greek citizens who
                    are permanent overseas residents.[93]

                    Antetokounmpo is an avid fan of the Greek multi-sports club Olympiacos.[94][95][96][97]

                    Thanasis made his NBA debut with the New York Knicks after being drafted by the organization with
                    the 51st overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft.[98] Antetokounmpo's younger brother, Kostas, played
                    college basketball for Dayton before being selected with the last pick in the 2018 NBA draft,[99]
                    while his other youngest brother, Alexis, plays high school basketball in the US.[100]

                    Early life
                    Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece on December 6, 1994, the son of immigrants from
                    Nigeria.[7][8] Three years earlier, his parents had moved from Lagos, leaving behind their
                    firstborn son, Francis, with his grandparents.[9] Even though Antetokounmpo and three of his four
                    brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically qualify to receive full Greek
                    citizenship.[7] For the first 18 years of his life, Antetokounmpo had no papers from Nigeria or
                    Greece.[10]

                    Antetokounmpo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia.[8] The New York Times reported: "Like
                    many other immigrants to Greece, his parents struggled to find work. Antetokounmpo and his older
                    brother, Thanasis, helped out by hawking items such as watches, bags and sunglasses."[11] In 2007,
                    Antetokounmpo started playing basketball[10] and by 2009 was playing competitively for the youth
                    squad of Filathlitikos.

                    Professional career
                    Filathlitikos (2012–2013)
                    In 2012, Antetokounmpo joined the senior squad of Filathlitikos and played for them in Greece's
                    second-tier basketball league, the Greek A2 League, during the 2012–13 season.

                    In December 2012, just days after turning 18, Antetokounmpo signed a four-year deal with Spanish
                    club CAI Zaragoza,[12] reportedly including NBA buyouts after each season. A number of other major
                    European clubs had been interested in adding him as well, including Barcelona and Efes, among
                    others.[7] With the contract starting with the 2013–14 season, he decided to stay with the
                    Filathlitikos for the remainder of the 2012–13 season.

                    During the 2012–13 Greek A2 League season, Antetokounmpo shot 46.4% from the field (62.1% on
                    two-point field goals), 31.3% from three-point range, and 72.0% from the free throw line, while
                    averaging 22.5 minutes per game. Over 26 games, he averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists,
                    and 1.0 blocks per game.[13] He was also selected by the coaches as a special participant in the
                    2013 Greek League All-Star Game. Even though he was not actually selected as an all-star, the
                    coaches let him play in the game as a treat for the fans.[14]

                    Milwaukee Bucks (2013–present)
                    2013–14 season
                    On April 28, 2013, Antetokounmpo officially made himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft.[15] He
                    fulfilled his draft projections as a first-round pick by being selected 15th overall by the
                    Milwaukee Bucks. On July 30, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks.[16][17]

                    Antetokounmpo averaged 6.8 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.8 steals, and 0.8 blocks in 77
                    appearances during his rookie season. He scored in double figures 23 times and grabbed 10+ rebounds
                    twice, with both efforts resulting in double-doubles. He finished the season with 61 total blocks,
                    which led all NBA rookies and was the seventh-most by a Bucks rookie in franchise history. He was
                    selected to participate in the Rising Stars Challenge at NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans, where
                    he tallied nine points, two rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes. At the season's end, he was
                    named to the 2013–14 NBA All-Rookie second team.[18]

                    2014–15 season

                    Antetokounmpo with the Bucks in November 2014
                    On October 16, 2014, the Bucks exercised their third-year team option on Antetokounmpo's rookie
                    scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season.[19] On February 6, 2015, he
                    recorded a then career-high 27 points and 15 rebounds in a loss to the Houston Rockets.[20] Three
                    days later, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played February 2–8,
                    earning player of the week honors for the first time in his career.[21] He later competed in the
                    2015 NBA Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All-Star Weekend in New York. On March 9, he scored a then
                    career-high 29 points on 11-of-16 shooting in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[22] The Bucks
                    finished the regular season with a 41–41 record, good for sixth in the Eastern Conference. He
                    missed just one game during the 2014–15 season, averaging 12.7 points and 6.7 rebounds in 81 games.
                    In the Bucks' first round playoff match-up with the Chicago Bulls, they were defeated 4 games to 2.

                    2015–16 season
                    On August 1, 2015, Antetokounmpo played for Team Africa in the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game,
                    representing Nigeria due to his parents being born there.[23]

                    On October 26, 2015, the Bucks exercised their fourth-year team option on Antetokounmpo's rookie
                    scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season.[24] Antetokounmpo improved his
                    scoring to begin the 2015–16 season, averaging 16 points per game over the first 20 games. He also
                    had a high two-point field goal percentage, hovering around 53% from inside the three-point
                    line.[25] On November 19, he scored a then career-high 33 points in a loss to the Cleveland
                    Cavaliers.[26] On December 12, he recorded a near triple-double with 11 points, 12 rebounds and 8
                    assists, helping the Bucks snap the Golden State Warriors' unbeaten start to the season with a
                    108–95 win.[27] On January 15, 2016, he recorded 28 points and a career-high 16 rebounds in a
                    108–101 overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks.[28]

                    On February 22, 2016, Antetokounmpo recorded his first career triple-double with 27 points, 12
                    rebounds and 10 assists in a 108–101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. At 21 years old, he became
                    the youngest Buck to record a triple-double.[29][30] On March 13, he recorded his fourth
                    triple-double in 11 games with 28 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 14 assists in a 109–100 win
                    over the Brooklyn Nets, becoming the first Bucks player with four triple-doubles in a season.[31]
                    On April 1, he recorded his fifth triple-double of the season with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 11
                    assists in a 113–110 win over the Orlando Magic.[32] Two days later, he scored a career-high 34
                    points in a 102–98 loss to the Chicago Bulls.[33]

                    2016–17 season

                    Antetokounmpo with the Bucks in December 2016
                    On September 19, 2016, Antetokounmpo agreed to a four-year, $100 million contract extension with
                    the Bucks.[34] In the Bucks' season opener on October 26, Antetokounmpo scored a game-high 31
                    points in a 107–96 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.[35] On November 21, he recorded his sixth career
                    triple-double with 21 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, five steals, and three blocks in a 93–89 win
                    over the Orlando Magic.[36] On November 29, he tied a career high with 34 points and added 12
                    rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocks in a 118–101 win over the Cleveland
                    Cavaliers.[37] On December 5, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played
                    Monday, November 28 through Sunday, December 4. Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks to a 3–0 week,
                    averaging 24.3 points (fourth in the East), 10.0 rebounds (tied for fifth in the East), 6.3 assists
                    and a league-leading 3.67 steals.[38] On December 7, he recorded his second triple-double of the
                    season with 15 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 115–107 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.
                    It was his seventh career triple-double; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar holds the franchise record with
                    eight.[39] On December 23, he had a career-high 39 points, eight rebounds and six assists in a
                    123–96 win over the Washington Wizards.[40] On December 31, he recorded 35 points, nine rebounds,
                    seven assists and a career-high seven blocks in a 116–96 win over the Chicago Bulls.[41] On January
                    4, 2017, he recorded 27 points and 13 rebounds and made a turnaround jumper at the buzzer to give
                    the Bucks a 105–104 victory over the New York Knicks.[42] With 25 points against the Knicks on
                    January 6, Antetokounmpo had at least 20 points in his 14th consecutive game, matching the longest
                    streak by a Bucks player since Michael Redd in 2006.[43] On January 19, Antetokounmpo was named a
                    starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[44]

                    On February 10, 2017, Antetokounmpo set a new career high with 41 points in a 122–114 loss to the
                    Los Angeles Lakers.[45] On February 19, 2017, he became the Bucks' first All-Star since Michael
                    Redd in 2004, and the first starter since Sidney Moncrief in 1986.[46] At 22 years and 74 days old,
                    he became the youngest player in franchise history to start in an All-Star Game. He also became the
                    first Greek NBA All-Star.[47] In the game, he led the East with 30 points in what was a 192–182
                    loss to the West. On April 3, 2017, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games
                    played in March. The award marked the first of Antetokounmpo's career and the first for a Buck
                    since Michael Redd won the award in January 2004. Antetokounmpo joined Redd, Terry Cummings
                    (January 1985) and Sidney Moncrief (December 1981) as the only four Bucks players to be named
                    Eastern Conference Player of the Month.[48] Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks finish an Eastern
                    Conference-best 14–4 in March, the franchise's first calendar month with at least 14 victories
                    since going 16–2 in February 1971. He averaged 22.4 points (ninth in the East), 8.4 rebounds (10th
                    in the East), 4.8 assists, 1.78 blocked shots (fourth in the East) and 1.33 steals in 18 games
                    during the month.[49] On April 10, he recorded his third triple-double of the season with 10
                    points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in an 89–79 win over Charlotte, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's
                    career Bucks record of eight.[50] Antetokounmpo led the Bucks in every one of the five major
                    statistical categories (points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks) in the 2016–17 regular
                    season, becoming only the fifth NBA player to do so after Dave Cowens, Scottie Pippen, Kevin
                    Garnett and LeBron James.[51] He also became the first player in NBA history to finish in the top
                    20 in the league in each of the five major categories in a regular season.[52] As a result of his
                    efforts, Antetokounmpo was named to the All-NBA Second Team, earning his first All-NBA honor.[53]
                    He was also named the recipient of the NBA Most Improved Player Award for the 2016–17 season,
                    becoming the first player in Bucks history to be named Most Improved Player.[54]

                    On April 15, 2017, Antetokounmpo scored a playoff career-high 28 points in a 97–83 win over the
                    Toronto Raptors in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. Playing his second career playoff
                    series, Antetokounmpo made 13 of 18 shots, and added eight rebounds and three assists.[55] In Game
                    5 of the series on April 24, Antetokounmpo set a new playoff career high with 30 points, but could
                    not lead the Bucks to a win as they lost 118–93 to go down 3–2 in the series.[56] The Bucks went on
                    to lose Game 6 three days later despite a 34-point effort from Antetokounmpo, as they bowed out of
                    the playoffs with a 4–2 defeat.[57]

                    2017–18 season

                    Antetokounmpo dunking against the Washington Wizards in 2018.
                    In the Bucks' season opener on October 18, 2017, Antetokounmpo had 37 points and 13 rebounds in a
                    108–100 win over the Boston Celtics.[58] Three days later, he scored a career-high 44 points in a
                    113–110 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He scored 17 points in the fourth quarter, including a
                    dunk that put Milwaukee ahead 111–110 with 11 seconds to go.[59] He was subsequently named the
                    Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the first week of the 2017–18 season.[60] In the Bucks'
                    fourth game of the season on October 23, Antetokounmpo had 32 points and 14 rebounds in a 103–94
                    win over the Charlotte Hornets, thus registering at least 30 points in each of his first four
                    games. His 147 points through the first four games are the most in team history—Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
                    had 146 in 1970–71.[61] Coming into the sixth game of the season, he had 175 points, 53 rebounds
                    and 28 assists, the best start by a player in NBA history through his first five games.[62] On
                    November 18, he grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds to go along with 24 points in a 111–79 loss to
                    the Dallas Mavericks.[63] On December 4, he scored 40 points in a 111–100 loss to the Celtics. It
                    was his third 40-point game of the season.[64] On January 6, 2018, he recorded 34 points, 12
                    rebounds and seven assists in a 110–103 win over the Washington Wizards. He had at least 20 points
                    and five rebounds in his 27th consecutive game, marking the longest such NBA streak since Shaquille
                    O'Neal matched it during the 2000–01 season.[65] On January 15, 2018, he recorded 27 points and a
                    career-high 20 rebounds in a 104–95 win over the Wizards,[66] becoming the second-youngest Buck to
                    record a 20-20 game behind Andrew Bogut.[67] Three days later, he was named a starter for the 2018
                    NBA All-Star Game, becoming the first Buck since Marques Johnson (1979–80) to be named a starter in
                    two straight All-Star Games.[68] On January 26, 2018, he had 41 points and 13 rebounds to help the
                    Bucks beat the Brooklyn Nets 116–91.[69] On February 15, 2018, he recorded his first triple-double
                    of the season with 36 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists in a 134–123 loss to the Denver Nuggets.
                    It was his ninth career triple-double, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for most in Bucks history.[70]

                    In Game 1 of the Bucks' first-round playoff series against the Celtics, Antetokounmpo recorded 35
                    points, 13 rebounds and seven assists in a 113–107 overtime loss.[71] In Game 6, Antetokounmpo had
                    31 points and 14 rebounds, as the Bucks pulled away late to beat the Celtics 97–86 to force Game
                    7.[72] The Bucks were eliminated from the playoffs with a 112–96 loss in Game 7, despite
                    Antetokounmpo's 22 points and nine rebounds.[73]

                    2018–19 season
                    In the Bucks' season opener on October 17, 2018, Antetokounmpo had 25 points, 18 rebounds and eight
                    assists and made two free throws with 23.7 seconds left for the go-ahead score as the Bucks
                    defeated the Charlotte Hornets 113–112.[74] On October 24, he had 32 points, 18 rebounds and 10
                    assists in a 123–108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, helping the Bucks improve to 4–0 for the
                    first time since the 2001–02 season.[75] It was his fourth straight 25-point, 15-rebound
                    performance to start the season, becoming the first player since Wilt Chamberlain (in 1964–65 with
                    the Philadelphia 76ers) to accomplish the feat.[76] On November 4, he had his second triple-double
                    of the season with 26 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists in a 144–109 win over the Sacramento
                    Kings.[77] On November 21, he matched his season high with 33 points to go with 16 rebounds and
                    nine assists in a 143–100 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.[78] On November 23, he had a
                    season-high 35 points in a 116–114 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[79]</p>
